# Mariupol Investigation Data 
As part of an investigation into the 2022 siege and devastation of Mariupol, Human Rights Watch, SITU and Truth Hounds are publishing data that helped inform the [project](https://www.hrw.org/feature/russia-ukraine-war-mariupol).  

Unable to conduct research in Mariupol, we relied on testimony from hundreds of survivors and witnesses, analyzed, verified and geolocated more than 850 photographs and videos, analyzed satellite imagery of graves to estimate the death toll, conducted a remote block-by-block assessment of the extensive damage in the city center, and investigated which Russian forces and commanders may be responsible for war crimes.   

We focused on damage to buildings on and around Myru Avenue, also known as the Avenue of Peace, a central artery of the city. Our investigation included analyzing 4,884 damaged or destroyed buildings in an area measuring roughly 14 square kilometers, which makes up a quarter of the city’s urban zone. Creating 3D models of seven buildings within this area helped illustrate the extent of the damage, and document it in case buildings were later demolished. These seven buildings, referenced below, each represented a different and unique part of life in Mariupol.
